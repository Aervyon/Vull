# Vull

Vull is a bot mainly aimed at moderation. It has some other commands for info but that is really it.
Vull is meant to be minimal.

# Consider this.

If you change the logger to 0 in `src/configs/customConf.json` Vull **will** break. It requires MongoDB to function properly.

If you edit the version in `src/configs/customConf.json` Vull will then proceed to show innacurate versioning.

# Setting up your token

Create a `templateConf.json` file in the `src/configs` directory.
Edit the config file to look something like this:
```
{
    "bot": {
        "token": "Your token here"
    }
}
```
Replace `Your token here` with your bots token.

# Configs

Anything else in the config is yours to play around with.
